# RDF Document Editor (RDE)

*RDF Document Editor* (or *RDE*) is a web-based RDF editor based on [SHACL](https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/), buit using React and [Recoil](https://recoiljs.org/).

It was initially created by the [Buddhist Digital Resource Center](https://www.bdrc.io/) but with the ambition to become an independent open source software.

RDE is best suited for the edition of simple records like bibliography, persons, places, etc. The records should be limitted in size (about 200 triples) and not be recursive (like taxonomies). This limitation allows RDE to have a simple UI and API that can significantly lower the barrier to RDF adoption.

The documentation is work in progress, but a demo is available on [https://rde-demo.bdrc.io/](https://rde-demo.bdrc.io/).
